🎬 Movie Ratings Analysis & Visualization
Project 3 – Internship at Hex Softwares
📌 Project Overview

This is the third project completed during my internship at Hex Softwares.

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize movie ratings data to uncover insights about audience preferences, genre performance, rating distribution, and popularity trends using Python.

The project follows a complete data analysis workflow from data preprocessing to dashboard creation and basic predictive modeling.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the movie dataset

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode)

Visualize rating distribution using plots

Identify top-rated movies

Analyze top-performing genres

Perform correlation analysis

Implement weighted ranking system

Create a simple analytical dashboard

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Features

The dataset includes:

Title

Genre

Year

Rating

Votes

Budget

Revenue

Additional features created during analysis:

Profit

ROI (Return on Investment)

Rating Category

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Checked for missing values

Removed duplicate records

Validated data types

Created new analytical features

Ensured ratings were within valid range

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Rating Distribution

Histogram and KDE plot

Boxplot for outlier detection

🔹 Genre Analysis

Average rating by genre

Genre vs rating visualization

🔹 Popularity Analysis

Votes vs Rating scatter plot

Analysis of highly voted movies

🔹 Trend Analysis

Year-wise average rating trend

⭐ Weighted Movie Ranking

Implemented a weighted rating formula considering:

Average rating

Number of votes

This provides a more reliable ranking of top movies.

🔎 Correlation & Modeling

Correlation heatmap

Linear Regression model to predict ratings

Evaluated model using R² score
